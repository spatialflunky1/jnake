# jnake
Terminal snake written in Java

## How to compile (outputs to <srcdir>/lib/build/libs/jnake.jar)
* Linux:
```
./gradlew build
```
* Windows:  
CMD:
`gradlew build`  
Powershell:
`.\gradlew build`  
  
Currently it will compile but not run because it depends on the linux `stty` command  
  
## Planned features
* Windows support
